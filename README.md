# random_inspirational_message_generator

The goal was to create an assignment using basic Javascript, Git Controls and Command Line to create a program that will display a message at random based off 3 seperate parts. For my program I decided on an inspirational type message that includes a positive complimentary adjective, a famous short quote and a randomized lucky number. This is reminiscent of fortune cookies and that was the basis I used for this project concept.
